# West-Nile-Virus-Analysis-in-Chicago

## Project Overview:
This comprehensive data analysis project focuses on studying the spread and prevalence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Chicago. Utilizing an extensive dataset from 2008 to 2019, the project applies a range of statistical and data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and trends in mosquito populations and WNV cases.

## Key Objectives:

## Data Cleaning and Exploration:

Preprocessing a large dataset to ensure quality and usability.
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand basic trends and characteristics.

## Analysis of Mosquito Trapping Data:

Evaluating the effectiveness of different mosquito traps in capturing varying mosquito numbers.
Investigating the relationship between trap types, mosquito species, and the occurrence of WNV.

## Spatial and Temporal Analysis:

Analyzing the geographic distribution of mosquito traps and WNV cases to identify high-risk areas.
Examining temporal trends and cyclic patterns in mosquito population data to understand seasonal impacts.

## Statistical Testing and Modelling:

Conducting statistical tests to assess the significance of findings.
Applying time series analysis techniques to decompose the data into trend, seasonality, and residuals.

## Results and Insights:

Identification of the most effective types of mosquito traps.
Discovery of potential WNV hotspots, aiding in targeted public health responses.
Insights into the cyclical nature of mosquito populations and the timing of WNV outbreaks.
## Tools and Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium)
Time Series Analysis (statsmodels)
Data Visualization and Geospatial Analysis
## Conclusions:
The project provides in-depth insights into the factors influencing WNV spread in an urban environment. The findings can assist public health authorities in developing more targeted mosquito control and disease prevention strategies, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes.
